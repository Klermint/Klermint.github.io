# How to Create your own Website
This repository everything I've learned so far to create your own Website.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
If you don't already have a GitHub account, sign up.

## Step 2: Create a new Repository
1. Log into your GitHub account.
2. Click on the **'+'** icon in the upper-right corner and select **'New repository'**.
3. Name your repository as **'your-username.github.io'** (replace **'your-username'** with your actual GitHub username).
4. Add a description if you want, and make sure the repository is set to **'Public'**.
5. Initialize the repository with a **'README.md'** file if you prefer.
6. Click **'Create repository'**.

## Step 3: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine
1. Open your terminal/command prompt or Git Bash.
2. Change directory to the desired project folder location: **'cd...'**
3. Clone the repository using the following command: 'git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io.git'

## Step 4: Create Your website
1. Navigate to the cloned repository directory: 'cd your-username.github.io'
2. Create an **'index.html'** file using the following command: **'Notepad index.html'**. This will be the main page of your website. You can use a text editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, or any other code editor.
5. Add your HTML content to **'index.html'** by copying **'index_sample.html'**.

## Step 5: Add CSS for Styling (Optional)
1. Create a **'styles.css'** file in the same directory and add your CSS styles by copying **'styles_sample.css'**.

## Step 6: Commit and Push Your Changes
1. Add all your changes: **'git add –all'**
3. Commit the changes with a message: **'git commit -m “Initial commit”'**
4. Push the changes to GitHub: **'git push -u origin main'**

## Step 7: Access Your Website
1. Go to https://your-username.github.io in your web browser. Your portfolio website should be live!

## Additional Tips (Not Tested)
* Custom Domain: If you want to use a custom domain, you can set it up in the repository settings under the "Pages" section.
* Themes and Templates: You can use pre-made templates or themes for your website. GitHub Pages supports Jekyll themes, which can make your site look more professional with minimal effort
